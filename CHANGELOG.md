# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.1.0-dev.7

This is a development pre-release.

### Added
- Implement the `GASPRICE` opcode.
- Implement the `BASEFEE` opcode.
- Implement the `GASLIMIT` opcode.

### Changed
- The `GAS` opcode now returns the remaining `ref_time`.
- Contracts can now be supplied call data input of arbitrary size.
- Some syscalls now return the value in a register, slightly improving  emitted contract code.
- Calls forward maximum weight limits instead of 0, anticipating a change in polkadot-sdk where weight limits of 0 no longer interprets as uncapped limit.

### Fixed
- A linker bug which was preventing certain contracts from linking with the PVM linker. 
- JS: Fix encoding conversion from JS string (UTF-16) to UTF-8.
- The git commit hash slug is always displayed in the version string. 

## v0.1.0-dev.6

# Fixed
- Compilation to Wasm (for usage in node and web browsers)
