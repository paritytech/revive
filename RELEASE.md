# Release checklist

Prior to the first stable release we neither have formal release processes nor do we follow a fixed release schedule.

To create a new pre-release:

1. Merge a release PR which does updates the `-dev.X` versions in the workspace `Cargo.toml`
2. Push a release tag to `main`
3. Manually trigger the `Build revive-debian` action
4. Create a __pre-release__ from the tag and manually upload the build artifact generated by the action
