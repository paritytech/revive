# Tooling integration

`resolc` achieved successful integration with a variety of third party developer tools.

## Solidity toolkits

Support for `resolc` is available in forks of the [hardhat](https://hardhat.org) and [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) Solidity toolkits:

- [The Parity Hardhat fork](https://github.com/paritytech/hardhat-polkadot)
- [The Parity Foundry fork](https://github.com/paritytech/foundry-polkadot?tab=readme-ov-file#2-resolc-compiler-integration)

## Compiler explorer

`resolc` is available on [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/z/6GM6n4Ka3) for the Solidity and Yul input languages. See also the announcement post on the [forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/resolc-is-live-on-compiler-explorer).

## Remix IDE

There is remix IDE fork with `resolc` support at [remix.polkadot.io](https://remix.polkadot.io). Unfortunately this is no longer actively maintained (there might be bugs and outdated `resolc` versions).
